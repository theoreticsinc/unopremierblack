Start shedding the unwanted pounds TODAY!\r\r\r\rNutrifab is a natural pickled plum infused with our special formulation and weight loss ingredients and comes packed with many health and antioxidant benefits which include:\r\rVitamin A, potassium and dietary fiber, also phenols which help to prevent oxygen damage to cells. Their soluble fiber slows down absorption of glucose, stabilizing blood-sugar levels. One of the best foods for vitamin K, and vital for strong bones and blood clotting. Much of the antioxidant power of Nutrifab can be attributed to the high levels of hydroxycinnamic acids, a type of phenolic compounds it contains. The hydroxycinnamic acids present in prunes include neochlorogenic and chlorogenic acids, both of which appear to be highly effective at scavenging free radicals. In addition to hydroxycinnamic acids, prunes and plums are rich in anthocyanins, flavonoid pigments with strong antioxidant properties.\r\rA study conducted by researchers from Tufts University in Boston ranked prunes, or dried plums, as #1 food in terms of antioxidant capacity. Using a laboratory analysis called ORAC Oxygen Radical Absorbency Capacity, the researchers found that prunes had more than twice the antioxidant capacity of other high ranking foods such as blueberries and raisins. With a score of 5770 ORAC units per 100 grams, the antioxidant power of prunes also topped that of fresh plums, which scored 949 on the ORAC scale.\r\rWhat additional ingredients does Nutrifab contain that makes it pack such a powerful punch for healthy weight loss?\r\rIt contains Garcinia Cambogia, the newest and most effective Fat Buster on the market that lets you burn fat without extra diet or exercise. Thanks to brand new scientific research, the secret that millions of people across the globe are using to shed pounds quickly and effectively. This revolutionary new Fat Buster is a pumpkin shape fruit plant from South East Asia. Garcinia Cambogia, maybe the most revolutionary fat burning ingredient discovered today. New research has found that this strange fruit may be the miracle answer that lets you lose weight without changing your diet or exercise.\r\rGarcinia Cambogia inhibits the production of new fat in the body, and when the body is not making fat, its burning fat. Scientific research shows that people using Garcinia Cambogia, lose two to three times more fat than with diet and exercise alone.  Not only does it help with weight loss, Garcia Cambogia also helps emotional leaders by increasing serotonin levels in sleep, elevating mood, suppressing appetite, and preventing new belly fat from formulating.  So Garcinia Cambogia acts as a true dual Fat Buster.  First and foremost, it suppresses appetite so you are not hungry. Second, it prevents fat from being stored by changing fat into glycogen for energy that your muscles will use when you exercise.  To demonstrate, here is an example, when you eat food your liver enzymes turn all of the sugar, bread and carbohydrates into fat cells, and your fat cells swell and absorb this fat and get larger and larger, which is the cause of belly fat. Garcinia Cambogia blocks these liver enzymes, and creates a new pathway to move the sugar, bread and carbohydrates into energy. By doing this, you prevent new fat from being formed. And your already swelled fat cells begin to shrink and convert that stored fat into energy. This new ingredient is the revolutionary new product the world has been waiting for, and has been touted as the holy grail of weight loss.\r\rAnd the 3rd component that completes Nutrifabs amazing proprietary blend is, Probiotics.\r\rThe word \"probiotic\" is a compound of two Greek words: \"pro,\" to signify promotion of and \"biotic,\" which means life. Their very definition is something that affirms life and health. Thats true even by modern standards: the World Health Organization defines a probiotic as any living microorganism that has a health benefit when ingested. Similarly, the USDA defines a probiotic as \"any viable microbial dietary supplement that beneficially affects the host.\"\r\rFor most people, the mention of probiotics conjures up images of yogurt or Yakult. But dont dismiss the microbes as a marketing gimmick or food fad. The latest probiotic research suggests that live-active cultures of these friendly bacteria can help to prevent and treat a wide variety of ailments such as IBM – Irritable Bowel Movement, UTI – Urinary Tract Infection, and bring balance to the womans reproductive organs to address yeast infection, also it plays an important role in obesity. It has also been beneficial in addressing healthy brain function, Allergies, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Infection, Psoriasis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\r\r\"There is an increasing interest in probiotic interventions,\" wrote the authors of one of the most recent studies, a meta-analysis of previous research in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Those researchers found that probiotics were particularly useful against a common gastrointestinal problem called antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). But studies show that probiotics can help with a great deal more – Warding off infection and boosting the immune system, as well as helping to improve overall health and even fighting obesity.\r\rSo add Nutrifab to your diet and begin making a healthier life choice!

"desc_Procardio" = "There are so many supplements on the market that makes claims of lower your LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol. Its true there are few, such as different fish oil containing Omega 3 and regular use of olive oil can help — a little.\r\rUnscrupulous vitamin companies claim they can also raise your good, protective HDL cholesterol. This is largely a lie. Until now, only very high doses of niacin could significantly improve your HDL, but most products made you endure frustrating side effects such as the \"niacin flush,\" that is, a beet-red face. .A few supplements make claims about triglycerides, another important heart health marker.\r\rBut until now no supplement could promise to improve your LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and more at the same time. ProCardio works on all three levels and works amazingly well and the first of its kind.\r\rA very good HDL number is above 60 and is one of the best ways to protect the health of your heart and arteries for life. But its very difficult to get HDL above 45 if you didnt inherit the genes for it.\r\rProCardio does exactly that it raises health good HDL cholesterol and takes care of ALL your lipids and the whole list of important factors for heart health.\r\r\r\rOur advice:\r\rTake ProCardio for a while and have new blood tests done. If you are like most people, your doctor will be very impressed with how good your health markers are. Hell ask you how on earth you did it?!\r\rAnd the best part of having excellent cholesterol, triglycerides, and other major health markers is that you wont have to worry about them. Youll be able to eat well and enjoy your life — the only requirements are a healthy lifestyle and just one to two ProCardio capsules a day!\r\r\r\rBut why do you need ProCardio?\r\rHeart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States alone, not counting other foreign counties. Heart disease mortality rate is estimated to one in every four adults who will fall victims to this form of death, following is stroke which in many cases its contributed to the same health issues within.   Lets take a look at one example and one of the biggest culprits of heart attack and stroke – Atherosclerosis.\r\r\r\rAtherosclerosis is a slow disease in which your arteries become clogged and hardened. It is the underlying cause of most cases of heart attack, stroke, and vascular dementia and is found in up to 80 - 90% of Americans and different nationalities over the age of 30. Fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances form plaque, which builds up in arteries. Hard plaque narrows the passage that blood flows through that causes arteries to become hard and inflexible, (atherosclerosis is also known as hardening of the arteries). It contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in people over 45. Soft plaque is more likely to break free from the artery wall and cause a blood clot, which can block blood flow to vital organs and in the brain.\r\rThe effects of atherosclerosis differ depending upon which arteries in the body narrow and become clogged with plaque. If the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart are affected, you may have coronary artery disease, chest pain, or a heart attack. If the arteries to your brain are affected, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a stroke. If the arteries in your arms or legs are affected, you may develop peripheral artery disease. You may also develop a bulge in the artery wall (aneurysm).\r\r\r\rTHE SOLUTION\r\rProCardio\r\rWhat is ProCardio and how does it work?\r\rProCardio was specifically design to address cardiovascular and stroke related health issues but in addition was designed and formulated to work as a preventative measure for stroke prevention and overall cardiovascular health and blood circulation. Its powerful ingredients also work on lowering bad LDL- Cholesterol and Triglyceride levels while raising good HDL-Cholesterol within the body and cleansing the blood.  ProCardio contains two major ingredients that effectively does this. The first ingredient ProCardio contains:\r\rNATTOKINASE EXTRACT\r\rNattokinase is derived and extracted and purified from a Japanese food called natto. Natto is made from fermented soybeans and has been eaten in Japan for about a thousand years. Natto is produced by fermentation by adding the bacterium Bacillus natto to boiled soybeans.\r\r\r\rBut what are its functions?\r\rCholesterol is a cause of high blood pressure. Natto is a high protein food like meat but contains no cholesterol. Furthermore Natto contains lecithin that washes out cholesterol as well as linoleic acid that makes blood flow smoother.  It was proven that oxidation of fatty acid, especially oxidation of LDL cholesterol was suppressed by Natto.  Natto also induces thrombus degradation thus dissolved prior thrombus. In laymens terms, it helps dissolve fatty build up in the veins and arteries and creates better blood flow.  In short, it gets rid of clutter or plaque in the veins by lowering bad LDL cholesterol which also causes the veins to harden. Natto also functions as a blood thinner. It assists in increasing the flow of blood, lowering blood pressure and dissolving blood clots that can cause heart disease and strokes.  Platelets in the blood can form clots in the blood vessels, restricting the blood flow which can cause many ailments including high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke.  Nattokinase has been found to prevent this from happening.\r\rThe second ingredient ProCardio contains is:\r\rRED YEAST RICE EXTRACT\r\rRed Yeast Rice Extract works in a similar ways with added benefits. Red yeast rice has been used in China for over 1,000 years for medicinal purposes and herbology and is known for being a traditional Chinese medicine. Its use has been documented as far back as the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD. It is taken internally to invigorate the body, aid in digestion, and revitalize the blood and improving blood circulation. It works by also lowering bad LDL-Cholesterol and Triglyceride levels.\r\r\r\rWhat are other known health issues that ProCardio may help with?\r\rA angina, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), atherosclerosis, hemorrhoids, venous stasis, varicose veins, peripheral vascular disease, claudication, pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, muscle spasms, hypertension, infertility, cancer, and beriberi.\r\r\r\rTerminology\r\r\r\rLDL\r\rIn a world of good and bad cholesterol, LDL is the bad one. LDL collects in the walls of blood vessels, causing the blockages of atherosclerosis. Higher LDL levels put you at greater risk for a heart attack from a sudden blood clot in an artery narrowed by atherosclerosis.HDL\r\rHDL cholesterol is the well-behaved \"good cholesterol.\" This friendly scavenger cruises the bloodstream. As it does, it removes harmful bad cholesterol from where it doesn't belong. High HDL levels reduce the risk for heart disease -- but low levels increase the risk.\r\rTriglycerides\r\rTriglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body and the most common that we digest. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.";

Our super antioxidant berryformula is so powerful and uniquely blended for optimum health performance thatthe moment you start integrating this supplement into your daily diet, in no time you will notice a tremendous health difference!  So if you think that you live a pretty healthy life style then think again! Regardless of all the exercise you do and all the greens and vegies you it there is huge missing denominator that is causing your body major stress and in many cases sickness! Now, unless you are eating total organic and raw foods on a daily bases which is the ideal thing to do but many of us dont have the time or luxury to do so.\r\rSo why do you needSante8Berries?\r\r\r\rThe foods that we eat today are not only filled with many fillers and synthetics but in most all cases lack the nutritional value our body needs. Even the soils where crops are being harvested for fruits and vegetable production are extremely depleted in nutritional value of vitamins and minerals our body needs. The calculus is simple, plants cant make minerals, and without minerals vitamins dont work. We are made of the stuff of the earth. Consequently, if the minerals are not in the soil, they are not in the plants grown in the soil; and if they are not in the plants grown in the soil, they are not in our bodies. As such, it is not surprising that any depletion in the mineral and nutrient content of our soils reflects an increase in nutritionally related diseases in both animal and human populations not to mention other hazardous health issues because of contaminants with harmful pesticides and herbicides in order to maintain crop yield. These extremely toxic organochlorine (OC) and organophopshorus (OP) derivatives kill our soils by slaughtering the symbiotic bacteria and fungi that promote nutrient uptake in plants. They also inactivate critical enzyme systems within the plant roots that are involved in mineral absorption,and they destroy the soil micro-organisms needed to create the organic-mineral complexes that naturally replenish the soil too be able to create the nutrition our body needs. This is why its not surprising that people in this time of age are getting sicker and sick due the wholesome of this problem, and therefore need to supplement themselves with alternative nutrition. Here is a declaration by the US senate; although this declaration was made in the U.S. this is happening worldwide in crop harvesting:\r\r\r\rThe alarming fact is that foods, fruits, vegetables and grains now being raised on millions of acres of land that no longer contain enough of certain needed nutrients, are starving us no matter how much we eat of them. -U.S. Senate Document 264\r\r\r\rThe remarkable thing about the preceding declaration is that it was issued in 1936―over 78 years ago!  And today things have gotten much worse!\r\r\r\rAs you know it is always best to get all of the nutrition you need to be healthy from your diet. Unfortunately because of the above information its almost impossible to accomplish this and most people do not have the time, discipline orthe knowledge to do so, especially with respect to natural, whole foods. This is where sante8berries come in. It makes it easy for you to get perfectly balanced nutrition, even if your diet is less than perfectly balanced.This does not give you license to eat poorly, nor does it replace a balanced diet. But it does give you the peace of mind knowing that you are filling in the nutritional gaps you may be experiencing from a less than optimal diet.\r\rThe Problem\r\rMost supplement companies indiscriminately mix ingredients together, with no consideration given to sourcing and blending, in the hopes that they create a good supplement. The key is synergy, and creating a synergistic blend of carefully sourced quality nutrients that will work together to maximize the benefit to your health.Furthermore, it is especially important that the source of the nutrition is plant based, and not synthetic.This is how our bodies have been designed to use nutrition. If you do not eat the perfect balanced diet (which is the ideal scenario), the least you can do is use an organic based antioxidant supplement that you can actually utilize. If you do not, then the money you spend on your supplements is unfortunately not even close to being maximized.\r\rIdeally, it would be best to derive all of your nutrition from a well-balanced diet derived from natural whole foods. Unfortunately, complete nutrition is very difficult, if not impossible, to get into our daily diet from today's over-processed commercial food supplies. How important is having complete nutrition in your diet?...\"Nearly all disease can be traced to a nutritional deficiency\".- Dr. Linus Pauling, Two-Time Nobel Prize Winner.\r\r\r\rTHE SOLUTION\r\rSante8berries\r\rThere are many berries antioxidant supplements on the market today but what we created has separated above all the rest.
